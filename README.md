## Dictionary

This app is a simple dictionary and thesaurus for which I integrated with the Merriam Webster API. 
I made use of Next API routing to create custom api routes and tailored the back-end functionality to handle all server-side logic and data fetching.

I used Fuse.js to create a fuzzy search bar that allows users to receive relevant results even in the event of a typo. 

Framer Motion was a suitable choice to aniamte the UI for smooth transitions. 

Over the coming weeks I'm intend to add a Wordle game and improve the thesaurus' functionality.
